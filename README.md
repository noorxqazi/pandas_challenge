# Written Analysis 
* From this dataset, it is clear that the charter schools performed at a higher success rate compared to the district schools based on the percentage of overall passing students. This is due to a number of factors, but the one that jumped out to me the most is the size of each type of school. It looks like the smaller and mid-sized schools outperformed schools with over 2,000 students by almost 35%. 


* It can also be said that spending more money per student did not necessarily positively impact their overall scores. In fact, it looks like the schools whose budget was less than $585 per student had a higher overall passing rate than the schools that spent between $645-680 per student. 

* From all of this info, we can assume that smaller schools outperform bigger schools, perhaps due to each student receiving the attention and support that they need. It can also be determined that "support" does not equate to money but rather several other factors that were not included in this study, such as teachers who are more involved or certain types of extra-curriculars that engage students and help them learn in alternate environments.
